## Build a visitor Guest Book end of week 4 project

# Project goals

🐿️ As a user, I want to visit the website and read the information on my phone or computer.
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to leave a message in the guestbook.
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to see all of the messages that have been left in the guestbook.

# Requierments

🎯 Create a page containing a form to leave a message and a list of all the messages that have been left.

🎯 Style the form and the messages so they're easy to read on multiple kinds of device.

🎯 Create an API POST route to accept the text from your message input form

🎯 Create a database to store the messages, and create a seed file to create the table

🎯 Create an API GET route to retrieve all the messages from the database

🎯 Fetch the messages from your API in the browser and display them on the page.

# Strech Goals

🏹 Add a delete button to each message, that sends a request to the server to delete the message

🏹 Add a like button to each message, that sends a separate request to the server to increment the likes on the message

# My process

1. created the form in HTML
2. styled the form
3. wrote the client javaScript to collect the info from the form, turn it into json and post it to the server
